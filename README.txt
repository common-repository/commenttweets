When a reply is made to a comment, a twitter notification (@twittername) will be sent to the original comment author to notify him/her of the reply. The notification will be sent from your Twitteraccount. 
This will allow the users to follow up on the comment and expand the conversation if desired.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin archive and expand it (you've likely already done this).
2. Put the 'CommentTweets' folder into your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Go to the Plugins page in your WordPress Administration area and click 'Activate' for 'CommentTweets'.
4. Go to Settings -> CommentTweets and write your twitter account details or go to twitter.com, make a new twitter account for this plugin and then go to Settings->CommentTweets and use this account for the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it possible to let the commenters decide if they want the notification =

In this version all commenters will receive the notification. In the next version it will be possible to check a checkbox to get the notification. 

= Why do I need a twitter account to use this plugin? =

You need a twitter account to make this plugin work because the plugin needs a place to send the notifications from. If you don't want to clutter your twitteraccount with these replies, make a new twitter account specifically for this purpose.
